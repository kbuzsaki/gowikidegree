/*
Implements a "Six degrees of separation" style search for the shortest "path"
between two wikipedia pages using an iterative deepening depth first search.

The search treats the whole of wikipedia as a directed graph where each link
from a page A to another page B is treated as a directed edge from A to B.

For more info, see the wikipedia article:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Six_degrees_of_Wikipedia

Here's an example (real!) shortest path from "bubble_gum" to "vladimir_putin"

bubble_gum
acetophenone
chemical_formula
nuclear_chemistry
vladimir_putin

This algorithm is less friendly to parallelization than the breadth first
search, but it should give much better memory efficiency at the cost of
additioanl cpu and network.
